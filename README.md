### Contribution Flow

1. If you want to implement something, only commit to <b>dev</b> branch

2. Once you're finished with your feature, open a <b>Pull Request</b> onto master branch and request a reviewer

3. Once the reviewer approved your change, <b>you</b> are responsible for merging the changes into master

4. lemie-api will automatically get deployed to <b>https://lemie-api.herokuapp.com/</b>  🥳
